# Student-Admission-Prediction

## problem statement :
                A student who completed his/her high school have a probelm in selecting a college and course.Using machine learning algorithms this probelm could be solved.
 
 
 ## Steps :
        * Importing libraries and reading data (csv file).
        * Extracting useful insights using describe,shape...
        * Visualizing how the variables are distributed.
        * Outliers detection(if present).
        * Encoding categorical variables.
        * Feature extraction.
        * Spliting of data
        * Applying suitable algorithms.
        * Performance Measurement.
        * Interpretation.
## Algorithms used:
       note : target variable is categorical variable (yes(1)/no(0)) type. Whether the student will select or not select.
       Logistic Regression:
                         A classification algorithm which is used to find the probability of success and events.It lerans a linear relationship from the data provided and introduces a non-linearity relationship using sigmoid function.
                            sigmoid function is represented by :
                                                          f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-beta*x)
                                                          
       Disadvantages :
                    number of features > number of observations it ,the algorithm leads to overfts.
                    non-linear probelms cannot be solved, because the boundary is linear.
                    
        Assumptions :
                * Independence of errors.
                * Linearity in the logit for continuous variables.
                * Absence of multicollinearity.
                * Lack of strongly influential outliers.
