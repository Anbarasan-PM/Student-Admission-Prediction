# Student-Admission-Prediction

## problem statement :
                A student who completed his/her high school have a probelm in selecting a college and course.Using machine learning algorithms this probelm could be solved.
 
 
 ## Steps :
        * Importing libraries and reading data (csv file).
        * Extracting useful insights using describe,shape...
        * Visualizing how the variables are distributed.
        * Outliers detection(if present).
        * Encoding categorical variables.
        * Feature extraction.
        * Spliting of data.
        * Data Handling (Oversampling & Undersampling).
        * Cross validations.
        * Applying suitable algorithms.
        * Performance Measurement.
        * Interpretation.
## Algorithms used:
       note : target variable is categorical variable (yes(1)/no(0)) type. Whether the student will select or not select.
       Logistic Regression:
                         A classification algorithm which is used to find the probability of success and events.It lerans a linear relationship from the data provided and introduces a non-linearity relationship using sigmoid function.
                            sigmoid function is represented by :
                                                          f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-beta*x)
                                                          
                 Disadvantages :
                    number of features > number of observations it ,the algorithm leads to overfts.
                    non-linear probelms cannot be solved, because the boundary is linear.
                    
                 Assumptions :
                   * Independence of errors.
                   * Linearity in the logit for continuous variables.
                   * Absence of multicollinearity.
                   * Lack of strongly influential outliers.
        
      Decision Tree Classifier:
                           A hierarchical structure which is used to predict continuous or classify categorical variables.
                           if-else is used for each node in the tree to classify and the edges is to move the next state.
                          
                      Disadvantages :
                          * Sensitive to outliers.
                          * A problem of overfitting.
                      Assumptions :
                          * Statistical methods are used to oredering the variables as root node or internal node.
                          * Feature values are preferred to be categorical.
                          * Based on the attributes values records are distributed recurvesily.
      Support Vector Machine :
              A supervised learning algorithm which is used for both classification and regression problems.The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.
              
                     Disadvantages :
                        * Not good for the data has more outliers, noise.
                        * Performs poorly in imbalanced datasets.
                     Assumptions :
                        * The margin should be as large as possible.
                        * The support vectors are the most useful data points because they are the ones most likely to be incorrectly classified.
     Random Forest :
